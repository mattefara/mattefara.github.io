							C # is a new programming language, object-oriented, and this is the definition of official Microsoft:
							<br/> "C # (pronounced" C sharp ") is a simple programming language, modern, object-oriented and type-safe, which will be immediately understandable to programmers of C ++ and Java.
							C # combines the high productivity of languages ​​for rapid development of Rapid Application Development (applications, RAD) with the potential of the C ++ language. "

							Apart from some term, the explanation of which is premature now, I would add that C # is a language suitable for beginners that look just now in the programming world. It 'also true that those who have already had experience with other languages, will find easy to understand the C # constructs.

							C # is a language which does not operate directly in the standards to which the programs are compiled into machine code, but, like Java, needs a virtual execution environment. In the case of Java, there is need of the famous Java Virtual Machine that allows programs (which have the extension .class) to be able to turn. The C # really needs the installation of so-called.

						<P> If after this long and boring description you still want to learn this programming language, then you have passed the first test to become the best programmers Ever (the second is to pass the final exam ...). </P>
