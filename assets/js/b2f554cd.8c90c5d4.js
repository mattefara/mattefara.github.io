I\'m an Italian guy passionate about technology and eager to explore new things.\\n\\nWhenever I come across something I find interesting, I will try it out and share my thoughts here.\\n\\nI hope this project can help me grow both professionally and mentally, allowing me to expand my knowledge.\\n\\n## Why not Medium?\\n\\nI have nothing against Medium or similar sites. However, I prefer to maintain my own site so that I have full control over it. For now, I\'m using Github Pages to avoid managing a server, but we\'ll see what the future holds.\\n\\nHaving a website can help me better track my achievements and accomplishments while also improving my English skills. Currently, everything is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).\\n\\nThis is my first time doing something like this, and I\'m excited!"}]}')}}]);
