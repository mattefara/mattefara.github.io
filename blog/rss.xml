            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This marks the beginning of my journey through the exploration of new technologies. I'm an Italian guy passionate about technology and eager to explore new things.</p>
<p>Whenever I come across something I find interesting, I will try it out and share my thoughts here.</p>
<p>I hope this project can help me grow both professionally and mentally, allowing me to expand my knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-not-medium">Why not Medium?<a href="https://mattefara.github.com/blog/welcome/#why-not-medium" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why not Medium?" title="Direct link to Why not Medium?">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>I have nothing against Medium or similar sites. However, I prefer to maintain my own site so that I have full control over it. For now, I'm using Github Pages to avoid managing a server, but we'll see what the future holds.</p>
<p>Having a website can help me better track my achievements and accomplishments while also improving my English skills. Currently, everything is powered by <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first time doing something like this, and I'm excited!</p>]]></content:encoded>
