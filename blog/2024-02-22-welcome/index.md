This marks the beginning of my journey through the exploration of new technologies. I'm an Italian guy passionate about technology and eager to explore new things.

Whenever I come across something I find interesting, I will try it out and share my thoughts here.

I hope this project can help me grow both professionally and mentally, allowing me to expand my knowledge.

## Why not Medium?

I have nothing against Medium or similar sites. However, I prefer to maintain my own site so that I have full control over it. For now, I'm using Github Pages to avoid managing a server, but we'll see what the future holds.

Having a website can help me better track my achievements and accomplishments while also improving my English skills. Currently, everything is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

This is my first time doing something like this, and I'm excited!
