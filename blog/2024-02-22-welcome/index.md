This is the starting of my journey through the exploration of new techonoligies.
I'm an Italian guy in love with techonoligies and that want to explore new things.

Whenever there is something that I think is interesting, I will try it and comment about it here.

I hope this project can help me grow professionally and mentally, so that I can expand my knonwledge.

## Why not Medium?

I have nothing against Medium or similar sites. I think it is worth maintain my site, so that I can do wathever I want.
For now I want to use Github pages so that I don't have to manage a server but we will see what happens.

I think having a site can help me track better my achivements and accomplishment, improving my English.
For now everything is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

This is my first time doing a thing like this, I'm exited!
