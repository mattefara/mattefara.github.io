# Homelab Intro
This is my journey about building my homelab. 
This homelab has the pourpose of me larning new things and experiment with new techonologies.

## Getting Started
For now the documentation is written with Docusaurus and I plan of putting this site on Github or Gitlab pages.

## Technologies
Everithing should run on Kubernetes and I plan on keeping everything private, except for some techonologies that involves CI/CD and needs some external access from Gitlab or Github.
The projects should use the DevOps principles, promoting automation using pipelines or others principles, like GitOps.

Let's get started!
