# Homelab Introduction
Welcome to my homelab journey where I delve into building and exploring new technologies.

As an enthusiastic Italian with a deep passion for cloud technologies and Kubernetes, this project serves the purpose of both learning and experimenting with the latest tech innovations.

## Getting Started
Currently, the documentation is authored using Docusaurus, and my plan is to host this site on either Github or Gitlab pages.

## Technologies
The entire setup is designed to operate within a Kubernetes environment. While most components will remain private, certain technologies, particularly those involving CI/CD, may require external access from platforms such as Gitlab or Github. 

The projects are aligned with DevOps principles, emphasizing automation through pipelines and adopting methodologies like GitOps.

Let's embark on this exciting journey together!
